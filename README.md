MirageMobile - Mirage Mobile AR Framework
======================================================

Mobile API and SDK for image recognition, retrievial, and augmented reality. Uses various computer vision, machine learning, and opengl techniques in order to create a open source competitior to growing AR and IR frameworks. The IR is built using opencv and flann. It's use NN in order to do fast matching on large dimensional data.The AR framework for now using a custom built opengl framework that takes in a modelview from the c++ front end. Plan are in incorportate a more robust opengl framework.
